# WhatsApp-Chatbot-Gradio
A chatbot powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Pro.<br>
It answers all your questions regarding the famous ***WhatsApp Messanger App***!<br>
*Try it Out!*

You can access it here: https://whatsapp-chatbot-gradio.onrender.com

Here, I have used Gradio which is used for demo testing of any ML/AI Project.
This website currently supports only the basic funcitons.
Only used for testing purposes.

You can also run this on your local device by clone this Repository and running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
uvicorn run:app --reload
```

This will run the ChatBot on your 'localhost' using FastAPI.<br><br>
(**Note**: It will not run unless you have your own ***GEMINI API KEY***, which you can put in your **'.env'** file.)

Also will try to make an actual version of this using Node and React (hopefully soon!) 

***Thank You!***
